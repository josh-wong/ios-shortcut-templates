> [!NOTE]
> 
> This shortcut is similar to [[Template] Choices+ to CSV](#template-choices-to-csv) but allows for granular choices to be selected.

Before running this shortcut, you need to make a CSV file in the specified folder. 

In the CSV file, create a header that includes the following, replacing the content in the angle brackets with the data that you would like to collect:

- Date
- Time
- Day of week
- `<CHOICE>`
- `<VARIABLE_1>`
- Location
- `<VARIABLE_2>`

## [Template] Choices+ to CSV

This Shortcuts template records a choice, additional choices related to that choice, and related information by adding that data to a CSV file.
